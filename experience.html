                <p>I transitioned to SoFi for growth opportunities. Almost immediately I have been able to participate in
                    projects outside of my regular duties. 
                    <br><br/>
                    I primarily take inbound and outbound phone calls, while also handling incoming chats with members. I'm responsible
                    for identifying the reason a member went delinquent, and determining an appropriate solution and meet performance expectations.

                    Lending Club was my introduction to the world of collections. With help from amazing leaders
                    I quickly aquired the necessary skills to be highly successful in collections. 
                    <br><br/>
                    In this role I handled personal loan collections through inbound and outbound calls. Multiple remediation
                    and pilot projects allowed me to demonstrate leadership and accountability skills.

                <p>Varo Bank was my first step into the FinTech industry. Through inbounds phone calls and
                    emails I assisted customers with their deposit products. 
                    <br><br/>
                    Shortly after training, my positon was
                    expanded where I was now responsible for supervisor calls and escalated account issues.</p>

                <p>
                    In this role, I managed a team of 12 employees at a standalone branch. My team consisted of tellers, loan officers, teller supervisors, and a receptionist.
                    <br><br/>
                    When I came into this role, the branch was not meeting baseline loan performance expectations. I was able to turn that around within a matter of three months, while also training two new loan officers.
